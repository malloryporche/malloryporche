### Hi there 👋, Mallory here (she/they).  

![Visitors](https://api.visitorbadge.io/api/visitors?path=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmalloryporche&label=VISITORS&labelColor=%23697689&countColor=%23263759&style=flat-square&labelStyle=upper)

I'm a software engineer with 3 years of frontend experience and a recent Hack Reactor graduate. Eager to expand my skill set and delve into full-stack development within a collaborative and established team. Outside of coding, you'll find me experimenting in the kitchen or spending time in nature whenever possible. Known for resilience and a persistent drive to overcome challenges. I love to chat and discuss all things development, devOps, and optimization...don't hesitate to reach out!

- 🗺️ I’m currently working on taking my MVP (scavenger hunt app) to the next level.
- 🌱 I’m currently doubling down on getting deep understanding of DSA.
- 💬 Ask me about anything, I love talking about all things code related.
- 🏃🏾‍♀️ Fun fact: I'm a newbie runner, and currently training for a marathon!
