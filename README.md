I'm a software engineer with 3 years of frontend experience and a recent Hack Reactor graduate. Eager to expand my skill set and delve into full-stack development within a collaborative and established team. Outside of coding, you'll find me experimenting in the kitchen or soaking up the sun whenever possible. Known for resilience and a persistent drive to overcome challenges. I love to chat and discuss all things code, so don't hesitate to reach out.  Let's build something amazing together!
